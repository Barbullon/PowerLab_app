<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">Climbing is a demanding sport in which you have to pull your weight upwards. To do this, your muscles contract to create a movement. Power is your ability to produce a quick movement under a large muscular load. In other words, it measures your ability to be both strong and fast. Power is essential for making explosive and long moves. And your ability to use your power wisely is an important skill for climbing efficiently.
