    <h4 style="color:lightgrey">1. Data Acquisition:</h4>

    <p style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px"><strong>Sensors:</strong> The app uses the gyroscope and accelerometer in your smartphone to record motion. These sensors are standard in modern smartphones. Download the "Sensor Logger" app to record data on your phone.</p>

    <h5 style="color:lightgrey">Smartphone App:</h5>

    <ol style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">
        <li>Download the free "Sensor Logger" app on your smartphone.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommended settings:</strong>
            <ul style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">
                <li>In "Recording Mechanism," switch on "Confirm Before Ending."</li>
                <li>In "Keep Awake," select "On & Dim."</li>
                <li >In "Sampling Frequencies," for accelerometer, gravity, etc., select "Sample as Frequently as Possible."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Before recording, ensure the "Accelerometer," "Gravity," and "Gyroscope" switches are on. No other sensors are needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5 style="color:lightgrey">Start Recording:</h5>

    <p style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">Click "Start Recording" to capture all data during the tests.</p>

    <h5 style="color:lightgrey">Phone Location:</h5>

    <p style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">Ideally, place the phone against the sacrum. Orientation doesn't matter, but it should remain stable during the test. A centered back pocket or running belt works well. Traditional back pockets can be used, but results may be slightly less accurate.</p>

    <h5 style="color:lightgrey">Power Test:</h5>

    <p style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">Once recording begins and the phone is well-placed, start the test as described in the protocols. Hang motionless for two seconds before the first pull. End the recording after each test; don't perform two tests in a single recording.</p>

    <h5 style="color:lightgrey">Export and Retrieve Data:</h5>

    <p style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">In the "Recordings" section, export your data. Confirm a successful recording by checking the data. If the phone screen locks during the test, the recording might fail. Email the data (use "CSV in Zip File"). Unzip the directory on your laptop and select it using the "Select Directory" button in the Power Lab app.</p>

    <h5 style="color:lightgrey">Settings:</h5>

    <p style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">If using other apps or professional IMU units, adjust the app's data settings:
        <ol style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">
            <li>Create a folder with accelerometer and gyroscope data in .csv format.</li>
            <li>Set the names of the .csv files for accelerometer and gyroscope data.</li>
            <li>Set the column header names for each file direction (x, y, z, and time).</li>
            <li>The accepted timestamp format is in seconds or nanoseconds. Ignore "" characters in the CSV file and pay attention to spaces and capitalization.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">If the detection of pull up fails you can try to cut your raw data by entering manually the start and end time of the test. Load and look at your "raw data" in the "Results section" before deciding where to cut it and re-run the app. (Cut the data around 3s before the first pulling acceleration peak and 3s after the last one.)  </p>
    <p style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">Warning: the new settings remain active as long as the application is open.</p>
