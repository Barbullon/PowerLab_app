<h3 style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 15px">Power in Climbing: </h3>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">As mentioned in the "About" section, the primary benefit of being a powerful climber is that you require less strength to execute long and fast moves. However, understanding the concept of power is not always straightforward. In the following pages, we will attempt to explain the meaning of power in a simple manner.</p>
<h4 style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 14px">Power Explained Trough a Simple Water Tank Analogy:</h4>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">Imagine your energy as a tank filled with water. The volume of water in the tank represents your energy, while the flow at which the water leaves the tank symbolises your power.And This energy flow go trough a valve which you can control.</p>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px"><strong>The Water Volume (Energy):</strong> Picture the water volume in the tank as your energy reserves. This is the total amount of energy you have available for your climb. It's a limited resource, and how you manage it can make all the difference in your climbing performance.</p>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px"><strong>The Flow of Water (Power):</strong> The rate at which water flows out of the tank illustrates your power. In climbing, power translates to your ability to quickly and effectively utilize your energy. The quicker you can release energy ,the more explosive your motion will be.</p>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px"><strong>Generating Power (Peak Power):</strong> Just as opening a valve on the tank can empty it rapidly, you can generate more power in climbing by efficiently tapping into your energy reserves and, when necessary, opening the valve to its fullest extent. The maximum flow you can achieve is your peak power capacity. It will be reached under two conditions: First, your water tank should be full. And secondly, the valve should be completlely open. If these two conditions are met, a wider valve allows for a more rapid and efficient release of water. You can picture peak power as an indirect measurement of the full opening diameter of the valve.</p>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px"><strong>Power Management is Key (Endurance):</strong> A skilled climber knows how to balance the flow of water and manage the valve effectively. They use power precisely when needed, ensuring that the tank doesn't run dry too soon. It's all about making every drop count and optimizing the valve to match the requirements of the climb. While resting, you can also gradually refill your tank. Climbing is not just about having a large tank; it's about knowing how to control the flow. The ability to maximize the use of your energy reserves by optimizing the valve's opening can help you conquer even the most challenging routes.</p>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px"><strong>My Tank is Empty (Fatigue): </strong>In our water tank analogy, fatigue can be visualized as a reduction in the flow of water because the tank's water volume decreases. A lower water level in the tank generates will result in a lower pressure at the valve. And just like in a plumbing system, lower pressure results in reduced flow. This reduction in flow corresponds to the sensation of fatigue you experience during a climb. It's a sign that your energy levels are depleting, and your body is signaling that it's time to manage your remaining energy wisely.</p>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">So remember that your power when climbing depends on the rate at which you release your energy. This release of energy depends 1: on the current water level in your tank and 2: on the opening of the valve. Also remember that these two factors are not fixed. They can change depending on the form of the day, the state of fatigue or voluntarily to regulate the effort.</p>

<h3 style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 15px">What Can I Test and Measure ?: </h3>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">If we recall the tank analogy, the perfect climber should have a large energw tank (for endurance), a wide valve opening (for peak power), a slow decrease of energy flow with fatigue (for power endurance), and should know how to manage his energy flow efficiently (for endurance). However, it is evident that this perfect climber does not exist, and improving one skill will often come at the expense of another. There is always room for improvement in many aspect, but it can be challenging to determine what should be prioritized. By tracking different aspects of your climbing skills and comparing your data with others, the trhee following tests will help you build a realistic profile of your climbing abilities.</p>

<h4 style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 14px">Peak Power Test: </h4>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">The peak power test measures how quickly you can release energy when you are completely rested and exerting maximum effort during an explosive pull-up. This test is also referred to as the "Arm jump" or "Slap test."
    <br>
    The main metric that describes this capacity is your peak power per unit of mass, measured in watts per kilogram [W/kg]. This metric is also known as the power-to-weight ratio. If you want power in watts, just multiply this metric by your current mass.
    <br>
    Another important metric is your mean power during your pulling movement [W/kg]. This mean power is directly linked to the maximum velocity you can reach and, consequently, the maximum height you can achieve with your hands.
    <br>
    The score of this test also indicates the peak height you reached relative to your initial hanging position. Additionally, it measures the displacement during the flight phase, which is the distance covered when you were no longer pulling.
    <br>
    In conclusion, a peak power test enables you to measure and evaluate your maximum reach capacity. And If you recall the tank analogy, this capacity is related to the maximum flow of energy you can release. You can think of it as the maximum opening of your outlet valve.</p>

<h4 style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 14px">Power Endurance Test: </h4>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">The power endurance test is designed to assess your capacity to endure high intensity exercises.
    <br>
    The metrics to assess this physical capactiy are based on the total work (or total energy) you can deliver before failure. And on the power-duration relationship during the exercise. 
    <br>
    Work (or energy): The total work assess to total amount on energy spent during all of the pull ups by units of mass [J/kg]. It measures the volume of the tank of energy you can spend during high intensity pulling exercise. If you want the total energy in joules, just multiply this metric by your current weigth.
    <br>
    Power-duration relationship and mean power loss rate: An other important mertic is the rate at which you lose power. It is calculated using the change of mean power output for each repetitions. This power output will decrease with time as you faigue. The slope of this power-repetitions relationship gives you a metric to measure your resistance to fatigue. In other other words, it measures your taverage power loss by repetittion.Its units is in Watt per repetition [W]. If your power decreases slowly (low slope) it means you have a high capacity tu sustain max intensity effort with small rest.
    <br>
    If we recall the tank analogy, we can think of it as a measure of the decrease in flow due to the reduction of your energy tank's water level over time. To further expand on the analogy, imagine two water tanks with the same volume but different diameters. As a result, the larger tank will have a lower water level than the thinner one. When you perform a pull-up, think of it as dispensing energy by filling a bottle with a constant small volume. For the larger tank, filling this bottle won't change the water level as much. Therefore, the pressure at the valve will almost stay the same. On the other hand, for the thinner tank, filling the bottle will significantly decrease the water level. Consequently, the pressure at the valve after the first repetition will drop, and the flow of energy will be reduced for the second repetition. In this analogy, the wider tank will experience a smaller change in flow over time, making it more resistant to fatigue.
    <br>
    Peak power loss:  The peak power loss shows the relative difference between your peak power and your critical power (the lowest power output before failure). It represents your power-generating capacity loss at failure in [%].
    <br>
    The cause(s) of task failure during exercise remains a topic of intense debate and highly depends on the intensity of the exercise.  Please note that this protocol suggests an exercise in the maximum intensity domain. This has the advantage of measuring the variation of your maximum energy flow when you keep your valve fully open and when you don't allow enough time for your tank to refill (short rest).</p>
<h4 style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 14px">Endurance Test: </h4>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">The main metric for this test is the maximum number of pull-ups you can do until failure. During this test, you can manage your energy flow to complete the most repetitions without exerting too much effort. The number of pull-ups is directly correlated to the total energy expended during the exercise. 
    <br>
    This test encourages you to explore and experiment with your energy management techniques. For instance, you can try resting while hanging between pull-ups or not resting at all to observe the impact on the aforementioned metrics (peak power, mean power, power curves, total energy, etc.). You can also adjust the size of the holds you are using, add weight, or use elastics to modify the intensity of the exercise.</p>
<h3 style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 15px">What Can I Improve ?: </h3>
<p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">Peak power capacity depends on two factors: maximum force (high load with low speed) and maximum velocity (low load with high speed). Both of these factors can be trained individually or together to improve peak power output. 
    <br>
    The reserve of energy and resistance to fatigue can also be enhanced by improving the efficiency of specific energy systems (aerobic, anaerobic lactic, or alactic).
    <br>
    In addition, managing energy flow is a lifelong skill that requires continuous improvement through understanding how your body works and reacts to different constraints.
    <br>
    In summary, there is always a possibility for improvement in various aspects, but it can be difficult to determine what should be prioritized. The nature of your climbing projects (multi-pitch, boulder, routes) and your climbing style (static, dynamic) will guide you in optimizing your training. By monitoring different aspects of your climbing abilities, this app can assist you in creating an accurate profile of your climbing skills. However, understanding how to enhance your climbing abilities is a complex question that is best addressed by coaches.</p>
