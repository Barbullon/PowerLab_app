Data

Raw Data
Norm in function of time gyr + accelero
smart segmentation ad square

Processed
	Vertical acceleration + velocity with detected pullup
	nb of pullup

Power test
score: Arm jump test
1 rep maximum power 3 min rest 3 set
	check max power
	add table

Endurance tests
Max pullup full amplitude no time limit 
	
	score: nb pull up
	total work stacked bar
	power curve
	high number of pullup with low work is good
	measure of efficiency two athletes with same total work, better is the one with more pullup
	?eneregtic efficiency minimum work = mgh efficency = pulling on rep work/mgh
	mean power during the rep. rep until dmax

Power endurance test
1 rep max power 3s rest until failure

	mean power over 3 rep bar bar chart
	score: mean power end/mean power start
	plot: power/power max
	plateau critical power ? total work up plateau W'
	w' effort which has a time limit, tank of energy limited in time

1. IMU data:
	
	This version uses Andoid app SensorBox.
	Select linear acceleration and gyroscope.
	Start measurement.
	Record data during the test. Make sure to follow the test protocol.
	Data are stored in a folder on your phone.
	All you have to do is to get this folder on your personnal computer.

2. App:

	Launch the app and select.
