    <p style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">A testing protocol is a systematic set of instructions for evaluating specific aspects of performance. Here, we outline three distinct protocols tailored to assess various dimensions of your pull-up capabilities.</p>

    <strong style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">Initiating the Test:</strong> 
    <ul style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">
        <li>Before each test protocol, begin by hanging motionless for 2 seconds at full elbow extension.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">Peak Power Test Protocol:</strong>
    <ul style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">
            <li>Execute an explosive pull-up, reaching to touch the wall above you. You are allowed to use legs and hips and a small swing as you are used to do in your training.</li>
            <li>Allow a minimum of 3 minutes of rest if repeating the test.</li>
            <li>If hands can't be released from the holds, continue the upward movement as high as possible.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <strong style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">Power Endurance Test Protocol:</strong>
    <ul style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">
        <li>Each repetition involves an explosive pull-up at maximum effort, emphasizing the rising phase. The descent can be deliberate but must extend until full elbow extension.</li>
        <li>Rest for 3 seconds after each repetition before proceeding to the next. After two seconds, grab the bar, wait for 1 second and pull.</li>
        <li>Conclude the test when unable to lift your chin over the bar.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">Endurance Protocol:</strong>
    <ul style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">
        <li>Perform as many pull-ups as possible, focusing on energy conservation. Allow breaks between repetitions, ensuring no contact with the ground.</li>
        <li>Conclude the test when unable to complete a full pull-up.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">Hold type, additionnal weight:</strong>
    <p style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px"> An advantage of using your smartphone is that you can eveluate your performance on any type of holds. You can perform the tests with added weight too. And if a full pull-up is challenging, using a rubber band for assistance is permissible. But <strong style="color:lightgrey; font-size: 13px">remember your setup</strong> when interpreting results. If you want to compare results, protocols have to be the identical</li>  </p>

    <p style="color:lightgrey;font-size: 13px">These protocols provide a structured approach to comprehensively assess your pull-up performance, ranging from explosive power to sustained endurance.</p>
